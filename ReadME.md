# Recursive Dungeon Adventure
This program is a console-based adventure game written in C++. The player explores a dungeon by choosing actions in each room.

## Recursion Strategy
- Each room is represented as a recursive function call.
- **Base Case**: The player chooses to exit the dungeon.
- **Recursive Case**: The player decides to explore deeper or stay in the same room.
- Indentation is used to show recursion depth, helping visualize progress.
